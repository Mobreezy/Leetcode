# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest 
substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = s = "s = "bbbbb""
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
